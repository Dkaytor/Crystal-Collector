# unit-4-game
Crystal Collector

This is a web application using jQuery.

The object of this game is to use 4 different numbers not yet known to you to add up to the computers random number.

The 4 unknown numbers are represented by 4 different crystal images.

You win if you can add up to the computer's random number.

You play until you either match the computer number or you go over the computer number.

If you match, the wins go up by 1.
If you go over the losses go up by 1.

In either scenario, the game resets to a new random computer number and
4 new random crystal numbers.
